Ah, I'll show you how to set this up using the Windows GUI Task Scheduler. It's simpler than using PowerShell commands.

Open Task Scheduler (you can search for it in Windows Start menu)
In Task Scheduler:

Click "Create Task" on the right panel (not "Create Basic Task")
In the "General" tab:

Give it a name (like "RunStartupScript")
Select "Run with highest privileges" checkbox
Select "Configure for: Windows 10" (or your Windows version)




In the "Triggers" tab:

Click "New"
Select "At log on" from the dropdown
Click "OK"


In the "Actions" tab:

Click "New"
Program/script: powershell.exe
Add these arguments: -NoExit -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "cd 'C:\runner'; .\run.cmd"
Click "OK"


In the "Settings" tab:

Check "Allow task to be run on demand"
Uncheck "Stop the task if it runs longer than"
Click "OK" to save the task



You can test it by right-clicking the task and selecting "Run". It should open an admin PowerShell window, change to your runner directory, and execute run.cmd.
Would you like me to clarify any of these steps?
